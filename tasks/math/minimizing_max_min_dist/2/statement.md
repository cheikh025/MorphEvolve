SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist focusing on point dispersion problems.
Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 16 points in 2D space, maximizing the ratio of minimum distance to maximum distance between all point pairs.

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
- Target: Beat the AlphaEvolve benchmark of min/max ratio = 1/√12.889266112 ≈ 0.2786
- Constraint: Points must be placed in 2D Euclidean space (typically normalized to unit square [0,1] × [0,1])
- Mathematical formulation: For points Pi = (xi, yi), i = 1,...,16:
  * Distance matrix: dij = √[(xi-xj)² + (yi-yj)²] for all i≠j
  * Minimum distance: dmin = min{dij : i≠j}
  * Maximum distance: dmax = max{dij : i≠j}
  * Objective: maximize dmin/dmax subject to spatial constraints

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **min_max_ratio**: dmin/dmax ratio (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
2. **combined_score**: min_max_ratio / 0.2786 (progress toward beating AlphaEvolve benchmark)
3. **eval_time**: Execution time in seconds (balance accuracy vs. efficiency)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds for all stochastic components
